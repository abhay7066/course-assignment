Q1. What is encapsulation in java?Why it's called data hiding?
    =Encapsulation is the fundamental principal of object oriented programming(OOP).
     it refer to building a data and method that operate data in single unit, called
     class. in java encapsulation is achieve by using access modifier that restrict
     data at class level and can be access by providing public method.q

     Encapsulation is also called or refer as "Data Hiding" because it allow internal
     object to be hiding from outside of class, it can be achieve by declaring data
     member mean variable as 'private' and providing public getter ans setter for
     access and update that private member.

Q2. What are the important features of encapsulation?
    = important features of encapsulation
       1.Data hiding
         = in this data member declare as private that prevent access of data member
           from out side of class.and for access that member public method getter and
           setter are used.

       2.Improve security
         = By restricting data field encapsulation help to protect data integrity from
           out side of the class. and can access and modify in class.

       3.Improve code Reusability
         = encapsulation data is more reusable because it provide well define interface.

       4.Simplified testing and debugging
         = By encapsulation it is easy to testing data.

Q3. What are getter and setter method in java explain with an example
    = Getter and setter are public method that used to access and modify private member
      of class from out side of the class.

      Getter Method
       = getter method used to access or retrieve the value of field.It use fir get and capital
         letter of that data field

      Setter Method
       = setter method is used to ser or update that field.

    Example -:
       class a
       {
          private int age;
          private String name;

          public void setAge(int a)
          {
            age=a;
          }
          public void setName(String b)
          {
            name=b;
          }

          public int getAge()
          {
            return age;
          }
          public String getName()
          {
            return name;
          }

       }

       public class person
       {
         public static void main(String[] args)
         {
           a obj-new a()

           a.setAge(14);
           a.setName(ram);

           System.out.println("age="+a.getAge + " Name="+ a.getName);
         }
       }

Q4. What is the use of this key word explain with example
    = the "this" key word in java is reference variable that refer to current object."this"
      key word used to distinguishing between instance variable and other variable with the
      same name.
      here mention some use of this key word
        1.Distinguish instance variable with other parameter
        2.invoke current object method
        3.pass current object as parameter
        4.return current object

        Example-:
           public class Example
            {
               private int value;

               public Example(int value)
               {
                   this.value = value;
               }

               public void display()
               {
                   System.out.println("Value: " + this.value);
               }

               public static void main(String[] args)
                {
                   Example obj = new Example(10);
                   obj.display();
               }
           }

Q5. What is the advantage of encapsulation?
    = Encapsulation refer to many advantage here some mention
        1.Data hiding-encapsulation allow to hid internal data from out of the class.
                      by using private specifier.
        2.Control over data- Encapsulation control over hoe to access data .
        3.Improve security- By hiding the internal data and provide access control
                            encapsulation provide data security.
        4.Reusability- encapsulation class is more reusable because they have welll
                       structured interface for access data.
        5.Simplify testing and debugging- here it is simple because access and modification
                                          can be by only by using public method.

Q6. How to achieve encapsulation in java ? Give example.
    = we can achieve encapsulation by following steps
       1- declare the variable as private
       2- provide public getter and setter

           let see one example for encapsulation

       example-:

       public class Employee
        {

           private String name;
           private double salary;

           public Employee(String name, double salary)
            {
               this.name = name;
               setSalary(salary);
            }

           public String getName()
            {
               return name;
            }
           public void setName(String name)
            {
               this.name = name;
            }

           public double getSalary()
            {
               return salary;
            }

           public void setSalary(double salary)
            {

                   this.salary = salary;

            }

           public static void main(String[] args) {
               /
               Employee emp = new Employee("John Doe", 50000);


               System.out.println("Employee Name: " + emp.getName());
               System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + emp.getSalary());

               emp.setName("Jane Doe");
               emp.setSalary(60000);

               System.out.println("Updated Employee Name: " + emp.getName()); // Output: Updated Employee Name: Jane Doe
               System.out.println("Updated Employee Salary: " + emp.getSalary()); // Output: Updated Employee Salary: 60000.0

           }
       }
